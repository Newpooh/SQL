#For this project, I used SQL to display the patient ID and create a column called payout_remaining that calculates how much each patient still needs to pay.

select patient_id
, procedure_bill - payment_received as payment_remaining
from billing;

#Selecting every patient ID and procedure bill, I'll create a new column that calculates the fraction of what the patient has paid toward their procedure bill. I'll call the new column payment_fraction and sort it from low to high.

SELECT patient_id
, procedure_bill
, payment_received / procedure_bill AS payment_fraction
FROM billing
ORDER BY payment_fraction;

#Converting the fractions into percentages.

SELECT patient_id
, payment_received / procedure_bill AS payment_fraction
, ROUND((payment_received / procedure_bill)*100, 1) AS payment_percent
FROM billing;

Display the patient ID, the payment_fraction column, and a new column titled payment_status. For 100% payment, write “paid”. If the payment is less than 100% but more than 0%, use “in progress”. If the patient hasn’t made a payment, write “no payment”.

SELECT patient_id
, payment_received / procedure_bill AS payment_fraction
, CASE
WHEN (payment_received / procedure_bill) = 1 THEN "paid"
WHEN (payment_received / procedure_bill) = 0 THEN "no payment"
ELSE "in progress"
END AS payment_status
FROM billing
;

# Next, I'll create more categories in payment_status. If someone has paid 100% of their bill, write "paid". If someone has paid 0%, “no payment”. If the patient has paid 75% or more, "75%+", and so on with 50% and 25%. If the number is under 25%, write "Under 25%". Naming the column "payment_status".

SELECT patient_id
, payment_received / procedure_bill
, CASE
WHEN (payment_received / procedure_bill) = 1 THEN "paid"
WHEN (payment_received / procedure_bill) = 0 THEN "no payment"
WHEN (payment_received / procedure_bill) >= .75 THEN "75%+"
WHEN (payment_received / procedure_bill) >= .5 THEN "50%+"
WHEN (payment_received / procedure_bill) >= .25 THEN "25%+"
ELSE "Under 25%"
END AS payment_status
